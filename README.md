#### By **Amber Wilwand**

#### An application to help Claire run her salon!

## Technologies Used

## Description

This application gives Claire a way to manage and maintain an organized list of Stylists under her employ and the clients they see! She's able to update, delete, and add new stylists and clients, and see all of their information at any time!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Clone repository.
- Open code in your favorite text editor. I use VS Code.
- Using MySQL Workbench, import amber_wilwand.sql to create a local instance of the database.
- Create an appsettings.json file in the/HairSalon directory, and input the code { "ConnectionStrings": { "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=amber_wilwand;uid=root;pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD];" } }
- Make sure to replace 'YOUR-PASSWORD' with your MySQL Workbench password!
- Head back into the program you're running the code with, and run the command dotnet build in the terminal.
- Now run the command dotnet run, and enjoy pretending to be Claire!
